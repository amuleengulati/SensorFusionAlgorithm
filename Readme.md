# Sensor Fusion Algorithm

This program is designed to compute the fused value by combining the input from multiple sensors provided at a given time of the day. Here, the sensors are providing individual values for specific times, which can be processed by the sensor fusion algorithm to compute a single correct value for distinct time values. The data is provided by the client in a .csv file, in which 3 parameters are specified, i.e., time, sensor name and temperature measured by the sensor at provided time.
